Netflix Clone

This repository contains the code for a Netflix clone web application created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The project mimics key features of Netflix, including a responsive layout, movie and TV show browsing, and a clean, interactive user interface.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: Built with Bootstrap to ensure the application is fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Movie & Show Browsing: Users can explore different genres and featured content, with visually appealing cards styled using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system.
Navigation & Layout: A fixed navigation bar allows easy access to various sections, while the content is displayed in a grid-based layout similar to Netflix.
Interactive Elements: Hover effects and clickable cards enhance the browsing experience, making the interface feel dynamic and engaging.
Media Player (Simulated): Includes a media player interface that simulates streaming, providing a seamless user experience for content preview.
User-Friendly Interface: Utilizes Bootstrap components like carousels, modals, and buttons for easy navigation and interaction.
This clone is a great demonstration of front-end development using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, showing how to create modern, responsive web applications. It serves as a learning project for developers interested in building interactive and visually appealing web pages, as well as a foundation for anyone looking to replicate the look and feel of popular platforms like Netflix.
